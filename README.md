- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Iâ€™m currently doing a big data masters in Madrid.
- ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· I was born in the world's most southern city: Ushuaia
- ðŸŒ± Always trying to improve my programming skills.
- ðŸ‘¯ Fun fact: I was featured in a french newspaper.

## My academic life.

* Graduated as a telecommunications engineer in 2019. 
* Got a scolarship to finish my studies in France, where I spent six months working on some machine learning projects and my thesis.
* Currently doing a masters degree in Madrid (Big Data)
* I have certified a C2 level in english and a B2 level in french.

## Online courses I've taken.

* Dataquest (all the four paths)
* MIT MicroMasters Program in Statistics and Data Science(Probability, Statistics, Machine learning with Python and Data analysis with R)
* UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN - Applied Data Science with Python Specialization

## Projects I've worked on.

Face recognition with a Raspberry pi camera: Using a raspberry pi, create a system where one can add people to a database taking some pictures, and then recognize those faces to open a door(in this case, turn on a led light connected to its output). System is access through an interactive menu throught the terminal. Using mostly OpenCV, Dbil and Imutils

Traffic sign recognition. Working with the German Traffic Sign Benchmark dataset, creating a model that's able to properly recognize the different traffic signs and classify them properly. Using a CNN model and the keras library.

Whatsapp chat analyzer. Whatsapp allows you to export your chat into a txt file, using this file, we can do some data analysis to get the most relevant information about our chats.

Flight delay predictor. Using the "2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations" dataset, we analyze some interesting data about flights in the US, and we can try to use some models to make predictions about delayed flights.
